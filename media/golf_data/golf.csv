2022-05-07|True|True|Glenview Golf Course|Since 2008 our S3C team has raised over $400,000 for families and individuals in our Cancer Community by hosting annual golf outings. Each year we sprinkle the proceeds around the Tri-State area by collaborating with Cincinnati Firefighters/Police, local schools, and various non-profits to identify families who need our help on their cancer journey. This year our host partner is the University of Cincinnati Public Safety Department to expand our reach to Cincinnati's urban neighborhoods. In addition to helping families directly through customized support, we award funding to local organizations for family outreach activities and support the Child Life Department at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.  %& We are a family organization that knows our small acts of kindness make an impact on others. With this on our hearts, we are gearing up to host 500 guests and requesting assistance from community partners like you to ensure a prosperous weekend. Your philanthropic support will enable us to continue our mission to help families fight cancer.  %& Below you'll find sponsorship options for our May 7th golf tournament.  If you have a donation or sponsorship idea that is not listed, please reach out to us to discuss.  We'd love your help. %& The ability to say yes to a family in need and financially support organizations and hospitals that are on a mission to give children a reason to smile keeps us motivated to continue our efforts. With your partnership, we will fulfill our passion. Thanks for your time, consideration, and generosity!%& Sincerely, Darryn Chenault & Dana Parker, Co-Founders%& 513-295-2855 or s3cohio@gmail.com%& S3C Tax Exempt ID: 27-0381283|Hello potential sponsors!

['Gavin Myers Kick Cancer Fundraiser']|[' I am Gavin Myers, Sophmore kicker/punter for the Lakota East Thunderhawks Football Team. For the 2017 Thunderhawk football season I am partnering with Kick-It to help cure childhood cancer one kick at a time. Cancer is a disease that has affected me personally with the loss of my aunt Mandy in June 2016 and my aunt Nicole just kicked cancer. There are also several Childhood Cancer Warriors in the Thunderhawk community that fight this terrible disease everyday.
